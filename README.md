# processed-multi-label-dataset

For the CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset, because the file size(2G, 59440 samples × 9519 columns) of CIC_AndMal2020_data_multi-label.csv exceeds GitHub limit (<=25MB), we upload partial data(1,000 samples). In the CSV file, the first 9504 columns is the index and features, and the last 15 columns is the label set (in which 1 means the sample belongs to the attack).

For the UNSW-NB15, we upload all the processed trainning set(101040 samples × 53 columns) and test set(53946 samples × 53 columns). In the CSV file, the first 43 columns is the id and features, and the last 10 columns is the label set (in which 1 means the sample belongs to the attack).
